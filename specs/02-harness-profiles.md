# Spec 02 — Harness profiles & adapters (harness-agnostic core)

The core is surface-agnostic: canonical actions → tracer → Weave. A harness plugs in through two pieces — an **adapter** (its hook mechanism) and a declarative **profile** (its event/field mapping). Assumption: the harness has a hook, or hook-like, system we can attach to.

## 1. Contract — canonical actions

Every harness maps its native events into this fixed vocabulary; it never changes per harness:

| Canonical action | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `session_start` / `session_end` | session begins / ends |
| `turn_start` / `turn_end` | user input begins / assistant finishes a turn |
| `tool_pre` / `tool_post` / `tool_error` | before / after-ok / after-failed tool run |
| `permission_request` / `permission_denied` | approval prompt shown / user denied |

**Derived, not hooks:** steering (mid-turn input, denial-with-feedback, input rewrite) and approval (a tool that ran was allowed). **Graceful degradation:** a harness that lacks an action simply never emits it — that span type is absent, the rest of the tree is intact. No harness must support all nine.

## 2. Adapters — one per hook *mechanism* (reused across harnesses)

Most hook systems share one shape: *run a command on an event, hand it the data.* They differ only in transport and registration, so one adapter covers the whole family:

- **`command-hook`** (default) — our `weave-agent-adapter hook` dispatcher (spec 03) *is* this adapter. Works for any harness whose hooks invoke a command. Reads the profile's `transport` for how the payload arrives:
  - `stdin-json` — JSON on stdin (Claude Code)
  - `argv` — fields as CLI args
  - `env` — fields in environment variables
  - `file` — a payload path is passed; read it from disk
- Exotic mechanisms (in-process plugin callback, HTTP webhook) get their own small adapter — expected to be rare.

A command-hook harness needs **no new code** — just a profile.

## 3. Profile — declarative, per harness (usually the only thing you write)

```toml
[harness]
name      = "claude-code"
adapter   = "command-hook"
transport = "stdin-json"          # stdin-json | argv | env | file

[events]                          # native event -> canonical action
SessionStart       = "session_start"
UserPromptSubmit   = "turn_start"
PreToolUse         = "tool_pre"
PostToolUse        = "tool_post"
PostToolUseFailure = "tool_error"
PermissionRequest  = "permission_request"
PermissionDenied   = "permission_denied"
Stop               = "turn_end"
SessionEnd         = "session_end"

[fields]                          # canonical field -> dotted path in payload
session_id  = "session_id"
tool_name   = "tool_name"
tool_input  = "tool_input"
tool_output = "tool_response"
tool_use_id = "tool_use_id"       # OPEN — confirm exists via M0 capture
transcript  = "transcript_path"
permission_mode = "permission_mode"
cwd         = "cwd"

[registration]                    # how the installer wires the harness's hook config
kind    = "claude-code-settings"
command = "weave-agent-adapter hook --harness claude-code"  # installer appends --event <event>
events  = ["SessionStart","UserPromptSubmit","PreToolUse","PostToolUse",
           "PostToolUseFailure","PermissionRequest","PermissionDenied","Stop","SessionEnd"]
```

### Canonical fields

`session_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_output`, `tool_use_id`, `transcript`, `permission_mode`, `cwd`. (The event isn't a field — it arrives via the adapter's `--event`.)

## How it's used

- **Hook stays dumb** (spec 03): forwards the raw payload; `--harness`/`--event` come from launch args.
- **Sidecar** loads the profile, maps native event → canonical action, resolves fields via `[fields]` paths.
- **Installer** reads `[registration].kind` to wire the harness's own hook config, emitting `<command> --event <event>` per event.

## Adding a harness

1. **Command-hook mechanism** → write a profile (events, fields, transport, registration). No code.
2. **New mechanism** → add one adapter, then profiles reuse it.

## Open

- Each new harness's hook surface (event names, payload schema, registration format) — confirm per harness via a capture spike. Claude Code's field paths are provisional until M0.
- Which transports / registration kinds real GPT-based harnesses need (`argv`? `env`? a `notify`-program path?).
