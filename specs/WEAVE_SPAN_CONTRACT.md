# Weave agent span contract

## Conversation unit

Each finalized coding-agent turn is passed once to `weave.log_turn`. The stable
thread ID is the Weave conversation ID; the harness session ID is the fallback.
The root is a typed Turn/invoke-agent span, with typed LLM, Tool, and SubAgent
children available to Agents views and Signals.

Root messages preserve the initial prompt and steering messages in order.
Assistant content belongs to typed LLM child output, which is the representation
used by Weave Conversations for assistant messages and reasoning. When a
harness exposes only its final turn-end reply, the emitter creates one fallback
LLM child so the reply is not hidden in root input. Custom
`weave_agent_adapter.*` attributes retain the harness and adapter identity,
session ID, working directory, incomplete state, configuration version, branch,
effort, compaction metadata, and filterable steering, denial, tool-error, and
compaction counts when available.
The root also carries `weave_agent_signals.trace_role`. Hook processes prefer a
non-empty `WEAVE_AGENT_TRACE_ROLE` launch value, then the nearest ignored
workspace selector at `.weave-agent-adapter/trace-role`, walking upward from
the event working directory through the nearest Git repository root. Outside a
Git repository, only the event working directory is checked. With neither
source, the role is `agent_session`. Recognized evaluator values are preserved;
unknown explicit values or roles that conflict within one session fail safe to
`other_system`. The role classifies the trace without changing its Weave
identity.
An explicitly observed turn model populates the typed root when no LLM child
provides one; observed native turn IDs and permission modes remain namespaced
attributes rather than being reinterpreted as cross-harness identifiers.

## Child content

LLM spans preserve available model/provider, structured output text and tool
calls, public reasoning summaries, finish reasons, response identifiers,
cache-aware usage, and historical timestamps. Per-call inputs remain empty
unless a harness exposes them explicitly; the adapter does not reconstruct
them from root messages or attempt to decrypt private reasoning.

Tool spans preserve redacted arguments and a structured result containing
status, observed subagent ID, output or error, and permission decision/reason.
SubAgent spans preserve type, stable observed ID, and timing.

The public batch API accepts a flat child list. A tool observed inside a
subagent is therefore a typed Tool sibling in the same turn trace, linked by
the agent ID in its result. The adapter does not use private SDK internals or
replay historical work through live context managers to manufacture nesting.

## Harness boundary

Profiles translate native event names and fields into the canonical domain
model. Optional named enrichers may read a harness-specific transcript, but
the reducer and Weave emitter never select behavior by harness name. Adding
another JSON-on-stdin command-hook harness remains a profile change unless it
opts into a separately registered enrichment format.

Codex opts into best-effort transcript enrichment for intermediate assistant
messages, public reasoning summaries, per-call usage, and model names. Hook
events remain authoritative for lifecycle, tool, permission, and subagent
state. A missing, unreadable, or changed transcript format degrades to the
hook-derived turn and fallback final-response LLM child.

## Timing and routing

Hook-entry timestamps are authoritative. The root end includes observed child
activity, and child times are clamped into that root window so historical
traces render coherently.

An explicit `entity/project` route is preserved. A bare project is passed to
`weave.init`, which resolves the authenticated default entity. The emitter
initializes the route only when it changes; Weave owns authentication and agent
endpoint routing. Per-repository routing replaces only the project portion and
preserves an explicitly configured entity.

## Failure behavior

Initialization and logging failures drop only that reducer handoff and are
recorded through payload-free diagnostics. A later turn is still attempted.
Shutdown requests a bounded provider flush. The adapter owns no endpoint
override, provider cache, spool, replay, cursor, or retry queue.
