# weave-agent-adapter: Weave tracing for agent harnesses

> v1 design. Implemented: capture, sidecar + lifecycle, WeaveSink (verified live), redaction, config, sampling, installer, packaging. See §14.

## 1. Principles

- **Normal Weave usage.** `weave.init()` once, warm client for the session → WAL, batching, retry, redaction, sampling all native.
- **Non-intrusive.** The harness is never modified. Hooks are external one-line commands (plugin auto-registers; 0 authored lines). The sidecar is a separate process beside the harness, not inside it.
- **Never block, never break.** Hooks do a µs local write and exit 0; all failure swallowed.
- **Harness-agnostic.** The core runs on a fixed set of **canonical actions**; each harness plugs in via an **adapter** (its hook mechanism) + a declarative **profile** (its event/field/registration mapping) — [spec 02](specs/02-harness-profiles.md). Assumes the harness has a hook (or hook-like) system. Command-based hooks reuse one adapter, so most harnesses are profile-only, no code. Claude Code is the first; event names below reflect it.

## 2. Architecture

```
 harness (untouched)
   │  session-start hook ──▶ lazy-spawn / connect ──▶ sidecar (1 warm weave.init, per machine)
   │  every other hook  ──(1 JSON line, local socket)──▶  │  in-mem trace state
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────  ▼
                                          Weave SDK (async/WAL/retry/redact) ──▶ Weave
```

- **Hooks = dumb emitters.** Read stdin → forward the raw payload to the sidecar socket → exit 0. No parsing, no SDK, no init, no network. If the socket's missing, append to a spool and move on.
- **Sidecar = the warm client.** `SessionStart` spawns it (detached) or connects if it exists. It calls `weave.init()` once and stays warm until idle — one per machine, multiplexing all sessions (§8) — holding correlation state in memory and translating events into Weave calls. This is where Weave's built-ins actually work (they need a live process).
- Why not init in the harness / the hook? We can't run inside the harness's own process, and a hook is a short-lived subprocess (init dies with it in ~2s). The sidecar is "init-at-startup" relocated to a process we control.

## 3. Non-intrusiveness (the constraint)

| Surface | Footprint |
|---|---|
| Harness source | none |
| Adopter code | none — plugin ships `hooks/hooks.json`; one static command per event |
| Runtime footprint | one detached sidecar process (scale-to-zero on idle) + a socket/state dir under `~/.weave-agent-adapter/` |

## 4. Span tree

```
session (root)                 SessionStart → SessionEnd
└── turn                       UserPromptSubmit → Stop
    ├── input                  the prompt
    ├── tool:<name>            PreToolUse → PostToolUse (+ permission attrs)
    ├── steering               mid-turn interjection / input rewrite
    └── stop
```

One trace per session (root call). Nesting via explicit `trace_id`/`parent_id` held in the sidecar — cross-process parenting is first-class in Weave (`call_start` accepts both).

## 5. Event → span

| Event | Sidecar action |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | ensure sidecar; open root `session` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` (no open turn) | open `turn`; emit `input` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` (turn open) | emit `steering` (interjection) |
| `PreToolUse` | open `tool:<name>` under turn |
| `PermissionRequest` | record on tool (prompt shown) |
| `PermissionDenied` | close tool `rejected` (deny attrs) |
| `PostToolUse` / `…Failure` | close tool ok/error (allow attrs) |
| `Stop` | emit `stop`; close `turn` |
| `SessionEnd` | close `session`; flush |

_Native event names above are the Claude Code profile ([profiles/claude-code.toml](weave_agent_adapter/profiles/claude-code.toml)); other harnesses map their own via [spec 02](specs/02-harness-profiles.md)._

## 6. Correlation (in-memory in sidecar)

Match `Pre ↔ Permission ↔ Post` to one tool call: primary = a tool-call id from the payload **if it exists** (open question — **M0 confirms**); fallback = `transcript_path`; last resort = `(tool_name, hash(input))` LIFO.

## 7. Approval / steering / rejection

- **Approval:** inferred — a tool reaching `PostToolUse` was allowed; recorded as tool attributes (`permission_decision=allow`, `permission_source`, `prompt_shown`), not a span.
- **Rejection:** `PermissionDenied` → tool closed `rejected` with `permission_decision=deny` + `denial_reason`.
- **Steering:** (a) `UserPromptSubmit` before `Stop`; (b) denial with feedback; (c) `PreToolUse` `updatedInput`. Each = a `steering` span.

## 8. Concurrency, singleton & isolation

One sidecar (fixed socket + `flock`) multiplexes all sessions: `dict[session_id → trace]`, each its own `trace_id`. `weave.init()` once + concurrent `create_call` from threads is Weave's intended, thread-safe path (`ContextVar` stacks; non-blocking deferred sends). Isolation: per-session state, per-event `try/except`. Global client is single-project; concurrent different projects → hold `dict[project → client]`.

## 9. Reliability & Weave built-ins

The sidecar runs the SDK, so **async batching, retry, and WAL** (`WEAVE_ENABLE_WAL=true`, crash-safe restart) come for free. **Redaction** and **sampling** are ours (`redact.py`; a per-session hash in the tracer) — the SDK's `redact_keys`/`tracing_sample_rate` only apply to the `@weave.op` path, which we bypass for the low-level call API. Autopatching is disabled (we trace no LLM SDKs).

## 10. Latency & safety

- On-path per hook ≈ local socket write (µs). Weave I/O is off-path in the sidecar.
- Hooks always exit 0, empty stdout (no decision), hard timeout on the write.
- Sidecar `flush()` on shutdown; `weave.init` runs once with autopatch disabled (`WEAVE_IMPLICITLY_PATCH_INTEGRATIONS=false`), the cost amortized over the sidecar's life.

## 11. Lifecycle

- **Spawn:** `SessionStart` (lazy, singleton). **Shutdown:** idle ~60–120s after last session / empty queue, post-flush.
- **Crash / no `SessionEnd`:** a periodic sweep drops sessions idle > TTL (frees memory); orphaned open calls are left as-is (best-effort). `WEAVE_ENABLE_WAL` covers delivery durability.
- **Subagents:** `SubagentStart/Stop` nest via `agent_id`. **Compaction:** `PreCompact/PostCompact` annotate.

## 12. Integration (zero authored lines)

One static command per event — `weave-agent-adapter hook --harness <h> --event <e>` — where `--event` comes from the profile's `[registration]`; the sidecar maps the native event to a canonical action (spec 02). Ladder: **plugin** (0 lines) → `weave-agent-adapter install` (1 command) → paste generated block (~9 entries). No all-events wildcard, so entries are generated per event.

## 13. Non-goals (v1)

- **Custom durability / crash-recovery layer** — v1 is best-effort and leans on Weave's WAL; no bespoke spool/replay.

## 14. Milestones

- **M0 — Capture:** ✅ `hook.py` + `tools/inspect_capture.py`. Pending: a real-session run to confirm `tool_use_id`.
- **M1 — Sidecar + core tree:** ✅ socket, warm `weave.init`, session/turn/tool spans, cross-process nesting, lazy-spawn/singleton/idle. WeaveSink verified live.
- **M2 — Permission/approval/rejection/steering:** ✅ (as tool attributes + steering spans).
- **M3 — Redaction, sampling, config; WAL flag:** ✅
- **M4 — Subagents, compaction, hardening:** pending.
- **M5 — Packaging + installer:** ✅ pyproject + `install`/`uninstall`. Pending: plugin manifest.
